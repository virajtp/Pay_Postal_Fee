# Pay_Postal_Fee

Every amount of postage fee of 12 rupees or more can be formed using just 4-rupee and
5-rupee stamps. Write a recursive function to find out a way of representing a value higher
than or equal to 12, only using 5-rupee and 4-rupee stamps. There can be multiple ways of
doing it, but you have to find only one way.

Input - 
An integer greater than or equal to 12.
Output - 
Values of the stamps that can be used to represent the input value.

Example 1 : 
Input: 19    
    Output: 5 5 5 4
    
Example 2 :
Input: 28    
    Output: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
